  <h3>Example Credential Wallet</h3>
  <p>
    This is a credential repository (aka wallet) demonstration website. It
    has been loaded during a credential storage request from a credential issuer
    website.

  <div ng-if="$ctrl.showDetails">
    <p>This website uses the Credential Handler API polyfill. It calls
    code that looks like this to receive a credential storage request:</p>
    <pre>
      const handler = new CredentialHandler(MEDIATOR_ORIGIN);

      handler.addEventListener('credentialstore', event => {
        event.respondWith(new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
          window.addEventListener('message', e => {
            // wait for message from the window we opened with what was stored
            resolve(e.data.credential);
          });

          // open a window (with the content you see above)
          const windowClient = await event.openWindow('/credential-store');
        }));
      });
    </pre>

    <button ng-click="$ctrl.store()"
